Perhaps there is too many restaurants doing the same thing as you want to do and the location you are looking at is too close to competing restaurants.   Knowing this data before you make a decision on where and when to start a business is crucial.  \n",

    "The data here is of the New York City vicinity and of the 5 boroughs and the 306 neighborhoods in NYC.  The data is a json file from \"https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset\".  We are also tapping into Foursquare API to get data from the type of venue near certain latitude and longitude.  This data will be used to many different people.
